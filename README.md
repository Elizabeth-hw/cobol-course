### Enterprise COBOL for Business Application Programming

This repository contains my personal workshop programs for the [Enterprise COBOL for Business Application Programming](https://ibm.biz/EnterpriseCOBOLforBusinessApplicationProgramming) course taught by Jonathan Sayles from IBM.

The COBOL programs inside the various folder here are compiled and created in Enterprise COBOL 6 on IBM z/OS 2.4 utilizing the IBM Developer for z/OS or the IBM Z Open Development.

#### About the Course
